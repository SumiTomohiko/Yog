title: Regexp#search and Regexp#match
desc: |-
  Regexp#match searches a substring at any position in the string. This must be
  done at the begin of the string. The current Regexp#match must be renamed to
  Regexp#search.
  
  bin/lalr1gram.yog uses Regexp#match expecting to search at the position zero.
  Change this.
