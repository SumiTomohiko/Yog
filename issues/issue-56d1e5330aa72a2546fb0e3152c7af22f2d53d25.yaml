title: Finalizer only for FFI
desc: |-
  One idea for SDL (SDL_Surface must be free'ed by SDL_FreeSurface) is;
  
    from sdl import SDL_FreeSurface
  
    # The Finalizer class must be implemented by C in src/ffi.c.
    class Finalizer
      def init(f)
        self.f = f
      end
    end
  
    # The following finalizer is shared in all of SDL_Surface objects.
    finalizer = Finalizer.new(SDL_FreeSurface)
  
    foo = SDL_LoadBMP("foo.bmp")
    foo.finalizer = finalizer
    bar = SDL_LoadBMP("bar.bmp")
    bar.finalizer = finalizer
  
  Then, if foo (and bar) becomes a garbage, SDL_FreeSurface in finalizer is called
  with one argument of the SDL_Surface object.
