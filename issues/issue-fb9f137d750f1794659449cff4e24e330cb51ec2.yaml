title: What is the best way when WIFEXITED returns false in src/process.c?
desc: |-
  In src/process.c, Yog checks a child process's status with WIFEXITED. In current
  implementation, if WIFEXITED returns false, Process#poll will return nil. Is it
  the best way? It seems to have to raise an exception.

  - The best way is returning a ProcessStatus object. See issue b1bd8fdba5d58e426b143aabf27948663b00b6ee.
