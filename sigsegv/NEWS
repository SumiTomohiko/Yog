New in 2.6:

* sigsegv_leave_handler is changed. Previously it was a normal function with
  no arguments. Now it is a function that take a non-returning continuation
  function and three arguments for it as arguments.
  Where you had code like
     int my_handler(void* fault_address, int serious)
     {
       ...code_before()...;
       sigsegv_leave_handler();
       ...code_after()...;
       longjmp(...);
     }
  you now have to write
     void my_handler_tail(void* arg1, void* arg2, void* arg3)
     {
       ...code_after()...;
       longjmp(...);
     }
     int my_handler(void* fault_address, int serious)
     {
       ...code_before()...;
       #if LIBSIGSEGV_VERSION >= 0x0206
       return sigsegv_leave_handler(my_handler_tail, arg, NULL, NULL);
       #else
       sigsegv_leave_handler();
       my_handler_tail(arg, NULL, NULL);
       /* NOTREACHED */
       abort();
       #endif
     }
* sigsegv_leave_handler now works correctly on MacOS X.
* Support for 64-bit ABI on MacOS X 10.5.
* Support for building universal binaries on MacOS X.
* Improved distinction between stack overflow and other fault on NetBSD,
  OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Linux, AIX, Solaris. Contributed by Eric Blake.
* GNU gnulib now has an autoconf macro for locating libsigsegv:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/MODULES.html#module=libsigsegv

New in 2.5:

* Support for MacOS X 10.5.

New in 2.4:

* Support for GCC 4 on more platforms.
* Added support for catching stack overflow on NetBSD.
* Improved support for catching stack overflow on Linux, Solaris:
  Works also when /proc is not mounted or lacks read permissions.

New in 2.3:

* Support for GCC 4 on some platforms contributed by Paolo Bonzini.
* Support for MacOS X i386 contributed by Bruno Haible.
* Improved support for Woe32 contributed by Doug Currie.

New in 2.2:

* Support for new versions of MacOS X contributed by Paolo Bonzini.
* Improved support for AIX 5, contributed by Bruno Haible.

New in 2.1:

* Support for MacOS X contributed by Paolo Bonzini.
* Support for Cygwin contributed by Paolo Bonzini.
* Support for Linux/ia64 and Linux/hppa contributed by Bruno Haible.
* Support for OpenBSD/i386 contributed by Bruno Haible.
* Support for NetBSD/alpha contributed by Paolo Bonzini.

New in 2.0:

* Modernized infrastructure.
* Added support for catching stack overflow on AIX 4, HP-UX, and BeOS.
* Dropped support for NeXTstep.
* The function sigsegv_leave_handler() no longer restores the signal mask.
  This must now be done by the calling handler (either through sigprocmask
  or through siglongjmp).

New in 1.2:

* Support for HP-UX contributed by Paolo Bonzini.

New in 1.1:

* Catching stack overflow now works on some Unix systems:
  - Linux 2.2.x with glibc-2.1,
  - Sun Solaris,
  - DEC OSF/1 4.0,
  - SGI Irix.
