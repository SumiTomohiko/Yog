<H1>GSNSDataExtensions.h</H1><hr>
These methods are extensions to the standard NSData object to handle Base 64 encoding.
NSData objects can be created from Base 64 encoded NSStrings and can generate Base 64
encoded NSStrings.
<br><br>
This code is based on a C coder/decoder originally written by Dave Winer.  See the top of
the .m file for his original comments.
<br><br>
This code includes an AltiVec implementation.  The AltiVec implementation can be turned off
by commenting out the COMPILE_FOR_ALTIVEC definition at the top of the .m file.
<br><br>
If the AltiVec implementation is not turned off, you'll need to compile with the "-faltivec"
option enabled.  In the current version of Xcode (1.5) to enable this, select the target in
the "Groups & Files" list, then show the info for that target.  In the "Build" tab, show the
GNU C/C++ Compiler Language options and turn on "Enable AltiVec extensions".
