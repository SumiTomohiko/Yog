Syck cocoa 0.1

The YAML project should work in XCode without any alterations. It builds a statically linked framework to syck. The header files should explain everything. Currently syck is not used for output, due to encoding constraints, and a slightly quirky method is used. This might/should be replaced with something that works in a similar way to Apple's keyed archivers.

Included is Kyle Hammond's very good Base64 code to handle data in YAML. Currently Altivec is disabled in his code, if you want to enable it change the COMPILE_FOR_ALTIVEC define at the top of GSNSDataExtensions.m.
